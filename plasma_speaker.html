						<h2>Plasma Speaker</h2>
						<p>A loudspeaker which varies air pressure via a high-energy electrical plasma. Just plug in your phone, turn on some good tunes and voila! Music!</p>

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>The plasma speaker was something I designed for the SPIE club at University of Alberta. I wanted to use it as a tool to help inspire other engineers that they could build cool projects too. The club focused on funding its members who wanted to build there own projects. This gave people the opportunity to build what every they wanted, weather they had a team or just wanted to work on something individually. The plasma speaker was created to show others that building cool projects like this is achievable and the club could give you the resources they need. In addition to club promotion, I though it would be a great project to advance my analog circuit design skills. It proved to be a very challenging task and took me quite some time to get right. Once I was able to break plasma speakers into elementary parts it became much easier to replicate its operation with my own design. </p>
						<h3>How it works</h3>
						<p>I have made a couple versions of plasma speakers but they both use similar signal processing and amplification techniques. They both require to modulate the audio signal using a technique called pulse width modulation. Then take this new signal and amplify it using a class D amplifier style circuit. Then feed the amplified signal into a flyback transformer to create the high voltage required to create the plasma as well as demodulate the signal back into its original form (well close to it, unfortunately a lot of noise was introduced in my design). The best way to conceptualize what is happening is to imagine the plasma arc as a cylinder in space. The plasma cylinder can increase and decrease its diameter. If we change the diameter in a similar way to the way we move a speaker we can create the same vibrations in the air, therefore creating sound. Its a pretty amazing and creative way to make sounds. </p>
