						<h2>Modern Weasley Clock V2.0</h2>
						<p>Since we received $1000 from 1517 at Hack the North for the Modern Weasley Clock, we decided to continue working on the project and start version 2.0.</p>

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/MWC2/face.jpg" alt="" width=230 height220/></span>The goal of this system is to prolong the life time of battery packs. Over time battery packs need to be replaced as individual cells begin to degrade. Our system is designed to transfer energy from the battery pack to any weak cell. The picture to the left shows the dissipation of 4 cells. Over time in a typical battery pack, cells will significantly degrade and its voltage will drop off sooner than expected. These weak cell(s) act as a “weak point” and reduces the ability of the pack to hold a charge. Once the voltage of weak cell drop, the entire pack voltage will no longer be sufficiently high enough to power the load even if the rest of the cells still output the correct voltage. The purpose of our BMS is to transfer charge from the entire pack to the “weak” cell before the voltage drops below the minimum operating point.</p>
						<h3>How it works</h3>
						<p>The goal of this system is to prolong the life time of battery packs. Over time battery packs need to be replaced as individual cells begin to degrade. Our system is designed to transfer energy from the battery pack to any weak cell. The picture to the left shows the dissipation of 4 cells.

These weak cell act as a “weak point” and reduces the ability of the pack to hold a charge.

						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/MWC2/internals.jpg" alt="" width=300 height=300/></span>The overall hardware design consists of a step-down DC/DC converter that outputs 5V. The 5V supplies power to the entire board and also charges the weak cell. A Hall effect current sensor, along with an analog to digital converter sends data to the microcontroller which is fed into the charge estimation algorithm. The function of the microcontroller is to determine which of the cells are degraded and then charges using a state of charge estimation algorithm. Once the weak cell is detected, the switching circuitry will charge this cell.</p>
						
						<p>The three primary functions of the terminal pins are shown in the three figures below.  Figure 4 shows the system measuring the voltage of the desired cell. Figure 5 shows the system supplying energy to determined weak cell. Each output pin, shown on the left has three capabilities, connect to ground, connect to power, or measure voltage. By closing the two relays, as shown as white switches, we can connect the output pin to power. By Connecting the one relay we can connect the output pin to ground. And finally by connecting the relays as shown we can connect the output to the ADC to measure voltage. </p>
